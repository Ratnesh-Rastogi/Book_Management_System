# Simple Book Management Project - Full Explanation From Scratch

This document explains the whole project in a simple way first, then slowly goes deeper. The goal is that even if you are new to React, Flask, databases, APIs, and testing, you can still explain this project clearly to a senior.

---

## 1. What This Project Is

This is a **Book Management System**.

It lets a user:

- View all books
- Add a new book
- Update an existing book
- Delete a book

These four operations are called **CRUD**:

| Letter | Meaning | In This Project |
|---|---|---|
| C | Create | Add a new book |
| R | Read | Show all books |
| U | Update | Edit book details |
| D | Delete | Remove a book |

The project is a **full-stack web application**.

That means it has:

- **Frontend**: the part the user sees in the browser
- **Backend**: the server that receives requests and talks to the database
- **Database**: the place where book records are stored

In this project:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Backend | Flask |
| Database | SQLite |
| HTTP Client | Axios |
| Styling | Bootstrap |
| Frontend Tests | Playwright |
| Backend Tests | Pytest and Newman/Postman |

---

## 2. Big Picture Architecture

Think of the app like a restaurant.

- The **React frontend** is the waiter. It talks to the user.
- The **Flask backend** is the kitchen. It receives orders and prepares responses.
- The **SQLite database** is the storage room. It stores the actual data.

When a user opens the app:

```text
User opens browser
        |
        v
React app loads
        |
        v
React asks Flask for books using Axios
        |
        v
Flask reads books from SQLite
        |
        v
Flask sends JSON data back
        |
        v
React displays the books in a table
```

So the real data flow is:

```text
Browser UI -> React Components -> Axios -> Flask API -> SQLite Database
```

---

## 3. Project Folder Structure

The root project contains two main folders:

```text
simple_book_management_may_2026/
|
|-- Client/
|   |-- src/
|   |   |-- App.jsx
|   |   |-- Books.jsx
|   |   |-- CreateBook.jsx
|   |   |-- UpdateBook.jsx
|   |   |-- Nav.jsx
|   |   |-- main.jsx
|   |
|   |-- package.json
|   |-- vite.config.js
|   |-- playwright.config.js
|
|-- Server/
|   |-- app.py
|   |-- requirements.txt
|   |-- setup_database.sql
|   |-- Playwright_Test_data.py
|   |-- tests/
|
|-- README.md
```

### Client Folder

The `Client` folder contains the React app. This is what runs in the browser.

Important files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Client/src/main.jsx` | Starts the React app |
| `Client/src/App.jsx` | Defines app routes/pages |
| `Client/src/Nav.jsx` | Shows the top heading |
| `Client/src/Books.jsx` | Shows all books |
| `Client/src/CreateBook.jsx` | Form to create a book |
| `Client/src/UpdateBook.jsx` | Form to update a book |
| `Client/package.json` | Lists frontend dependencies and scripts |
| `Client/vite.config.js` | Vite configuration |
| `Client/playwright.config.js` | Frontend test configuration |

### Server Folder

The `Server` folder contains the Flask API and backend tests.

Important files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Server/app.py` | Main Flask backend |
| `Server/requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `Server/setup_database.sql` | Database table reference |
| `Server/Playwright_Test_data.py` | Adds sample books into SQLite |
| `Server/tests/pytest/test_books_api.py` | Pytest backend API tests |
| `Server/tests/postman_newman/` | Newman/Postman API test collection |
| `Server/tests/unified_report/test-report-generator.py` | Generates combined HTML test report |

---

## 4. What Is React?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces.

Instead of writing one huge HTML file, React lets us split the UI into smaller pieces called **components**.

Example:

```text
App
|-- Nav
|-- Books
|-- CreateBook
|-- UpdateBook
```

Each component has one job.

For example:

- `Nav.jsx` displays the title
- `Books.jsx` displays the book table
- `CreateBook.jsx` displays the add-book form
- `UpdateBook.jsx` displays the edit-book form

This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

---

## 5. React Entry Point: `main.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/main.jsx
```

Code idea:

```jsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

This means:

1. Find the HTML element with ID `root`.
2. Put the React app inside it.
3. Start rendering the `App` component.

The actual `root` element is inside:

```text
Client/index.html
```

So `main.jsx` is like the ignition switch of the frontend.

---

## 6. Main React Component: `App.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/App.jsx
```

This component controls routing.

Routing means showing different screens based on the URL.

The app has these routes:

| URL | Component | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `Books` | Show all books |
| `/create` | `CreateBook` | Add a new book |
| `/update` | `UpdateBook` | Edit a selected book |

The structure is:

```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
  <Nav />
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Books />} />
    <Route path="/create" element={<CreateBook />} />
    <Route path="/update" element={<UpdateBook />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### Important Concept: Single Page Application

This React app is a **Single Page Application**, or SPA.

That means the browser does not fully reload a new HTML page every time the user changes pages. React changes the visible component on the screen.

So when the user goes from `/` to `/create`, React swaps `Books` with `CreateBook`.

---

## 7. Navigation Component: `Nav.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/Nav.jsx
```

This component displays:

```text
Book Management System
```

It uses Bootstrap classes:

```jsx
className='d-flex justify-content-center py-2 shadow-sm fs-2 fw-bold'
```

Meaning:

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `d-flex` | Use flexbox |
| `justify-content-center` | Center horizontally |
| `py-2` | Add vertical padding |
| `shadow-sm` | Small shadow |
| `fs-2` | Font size level 2 |
| `fw-bold` | Bold text |

This is a simple design choice: the header is always visible because `Nav` is outside the routes in `App.jsx`.

---

## 8. Books List Page: `Books.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/Books.jsx
```

This is one of the most important frontend files.

Its job:

- Store the list of books
- Fetch books from Flask
- Display books in a table
- Navigate to create page
- Navigate to update page
- Delete books

### State

It has this state:

```jsx
const [books, setBooks] = useState([]);
```

This means:

- `books` is the current list of books.
- `setBooks` is used to update the list.
- The initial value is an empty array.

In React, when state changes, the component re-renders.

So when data arrives from the backend, React updates the table automatically.

### Fetching Books

The component uses:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  axios.get('http://localhost:5001')
    .then(res => {
      if (Array.isArray(res.data)) {
        setBooks(res.data);
      }
    })
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
}, []);
```

This means:

1. When the component first loads, call the backend.
2. Backend endpoint is `GET http://localhost:5001/`.
3. If response data is an array, store it in `books`.
4. React then displays the books.

The empty dependency array `[]` means:

```text
Run this effect only once when the component first appears.
```

### Displaying Books

If books exist, it shows a table.

If no books exist, it shows:

```text
No records
```

Each book row shows:

- Publisher
- Book name
- Date
- Cost
- Update button
- Delete button

### Update Button

The update function is:

```jsx
const handleUpdate = (book) => {
  navigate('/update', { state: { book } });
};
```

This sends the selected book to the update page using React Router state.

So the update page does not fetch the book again from the backend. It receives the book from the list page.

### Delete Button

The delete function is:

```jsx
axios.delete(`http://localhost:5001/delete/${bookId}`)
  .then(() => {
    setBooks(books.filter(book => book.id !== bookId));
  })
```

This means:

1. Send delete request to Flask.
2. If successful, remove that book from the frontend state.
3. The table updates without needing a full reload.

---

## 9. Create Book Page: `CreateBook.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/CreateBook.jsx
```

This page shows a form for adding a new book.

It uses state:

```jsx
const [values, setValues] = useState({
  publisher: "",
  name: "",
  date: '',
  cost: ''
})
```

The form has fields:

- Publisher
- Book name
- Publish date
- Cost

When the user types, React updates `values`.

Example:

```jsx
onChange={(e)=> setValues({...values, publisher: e.target.value})}
```

This means:

```text
Keep all previous form values, but update publisher.
```

The `...values` part is called the **spread operator**.

### Submit Form

When the form is submitted:

```jsx
axios.post('http://localhost:5001/create', values)
  .then(res => navigate('/'))
```

This means:

1. Stop normal browser form reload.
2. Send form data to Flask.
3. If successful, go back to the book list.

### Cost Field Naming

The form now stores cost as lowercase:

```js
cost
```

The Flask backend also reads lowercase:

```py
new_book['cost']
```

This is important because JSON keys are case-sensitive. Earlier, the project had a mismatch between `Cost` and `cost`. We changed the app to use lowercase `cost` consistently in React, Flask, and SQLite.

---

## 10. Update Book Page: `UpdateBook.jsx`

File:

```text
Client/src/UpdateBook.jsx
```

This page edits an existing book.

It receives the selected book from router state:

```jsx
const location = useLocation();
const book = location.state?.book;
```

Then it fills the form with that book:

```jsx
const [values, setValues] = useState({
  publisher: book?.publisher || '',
  name: book?.name || '',
  date: book?.date || '',
  cost: book?.cost ?? book?.Cost ?? ''
});
```

When submitted:

```jsx
axios.put(`http://localhost:5001/update/${book.id}`, {
  ...values,
  cost: Number(values.cost)
})
  .then(() => navigate('/'))
```

This sends a PUT request to Flask.

### Important Update Fix

Earlier, update could fail with:

```text
PUT /update/<id> 400
```

The main reason was old data and old code using uppercase `Cost`, while the newer backend validation expected lowercase `cost`.

Example old shape:

```jsx
{
  Cost: 67.0
}
```

Example new shape:

```jsx
{
  cost: 67.0
}
```

Because JSON keys are case-sensitive, `Cost` and `cost` are different fields.

The update page now handles both:

```jsx
cost: book?.cost ?? book?.Cost ?? ''
```

It also converts the cost field to a number before sending it:

```jsx
cost: Number(values.cost)
```

If `/update` is opened directly without selecting a book first, the page now shows a safe message and a link back to the book list instead of crashing.

A still stronger future design would use:

```text
/update/:id
```

Then the update page could fetch the book by ID.

That would be a more advanced and reliable design.

---

## 11. What Is Axios?

Axios is a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.

In this project, React uses Axios to talk to Flask.

Examples:

```js
axios.get('http://localhost:5001')
axios.post('http://localhost:5001/create', values)
axios.put(`http://localhost:5001/update/${book.id}`, values)
axios.delete(`http://localhost:5001/delete/${bookId}`)
```

Axios is the messenger between frontend and backend.

---

## 12. What Is Flask?

Flask is a Python web framework.

It lets us create server routes like:

```py
@app.route('/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_books():
    ...
```

A route means:

```text
When someone visits this URL with this HTTP method, run this function.
```

In this project, Flask exposes API endpoints for CRUD operations.

---

## 13. Flask App: `app.py`

File:

```text
Server/app.py
```

Main imports:

```py
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_cors import CORS
import sqlite3
import os
```

Meaning:

| Import | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Flask` | Creates the server app |
| `jsonify` | Converts Python data into JSON response |
| `request` | Reads incoming request body |
| `CORS` | Allows React frontend to call Flask backend |
| `sqlite3` | Talks to SQLite database |
| `os` | Builds file paths |

### App Creation

```py
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
```

This creates the Flask app and enables CORS.

CORS is important because:

```text
React runs on localhost:5173
Flask runs on localhost:5001
```

Browsers treat those as different origins, so CORS permission is needed.

---

## 14. Database Design

The database is SQLite.

SQLite is a simple file-based database. It does not need a separate database server.

The database file is:

```text
Server/books.db
```

The database path is created like this:

```py
DB_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'books.db')
```

This means:

```text
Create books.db in the same folder as app.py.
```

### Table Design

The table is called:

```text
book
```

It has these columns:

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique book ID |
| `publisher` | TEXT NOT NULL | Publisher name |
| `name` | TEXT NOT NULL | Book title |
| `date` | TEXT NOT NULL | Publish date |
| `cost` | REAL NOT NULL | Book cost |

SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS book (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    publisher TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    cost REAL NOT NULL
)
```

### Why `id` Is Important

The `id` is the unique identifier.

Two books can have the same name, but their IDs will be different.

The backend uses ID for update and delete:

```text
PUT /update/1
DELETE /delete/1
```

---

## 15. Database Connection Function

In `app.py`:

```py
def get_db_connection():
    connection = sqlite3.connect(get_db_path(), timeout=10)
    connection.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    ensure_schema(connection)
    return connection
```

This function:

1. Opens a connection to the SQLite database.
2. Sets `row_factory` so rows behave like dictionaries.
3. Ensures the `book` table exists.
4. Returns the connection.

Because of `sqlite3.Row`, Flask can convert rows like this:

```py
dict(row)
```

That helps send clean JSON to React.

During normal app usage, the backend uses:

```text
Server/books.db
```

During Pytest, the backend uses a separate temporary SQLite database:

```text
simple_book_management_test_books.db
```

This prevents automated tests from locking or damaging the real app database.

---

## 16. Database Initialization

Function:

```py
def init_db():
    ...
```

It creates the `book` table if it does not already exist.

It runs only when app.py is started directly:

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    init_db()
    app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

Meaning:

```text
When we run python app.py, create table first, then start server.
```

---

## 17. API Endpoint: Get All Books

Route:

```py
@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def get_books():
```

Used by React:

```js
axios.get('http://localhost:5001')
```

Backend logic:

```py
cursor.execute("SELECT id, publisher, name, date, cost AS cost FROM book")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
return jsonify([dict(row) for row in rows])
```

This means:

1. Open database.
2. Run SQL query to get all books.
3. Convert rows into dictionaries.
4. Return JSON array.

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "publisher": "Penguin",
    "name": "Python Basics",
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "cost": 299.99
  }
]
```

---

## 18. API Endpoint: Create Book

Route:

```py
@app.route('/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_books():
```

Used by React:

```js
axios.post('http://localhost:5001/create', values)
```

Backend logic:

```py
new_book = request.get_json(silent=True)
validation_error = validate_book_payload(new_book)
if validation_error:
    return jsonify({"error": validation_error}), 400

cursor.execute(
    "INSERT INTO book (publisher, name, date, cost) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
    (new_book['publisher'], new_book['name'], new_book['date'], new_book['cost'])
)
```

This means:

1. Read JSON body from request.
2. Validate that required fields are present.
3. Validate that `cost` is numeric.
4. Validate that `date` uses `YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. Insert the values into SQLite.
6. Return the created book with status `201`.

HTTP status `201` means:

```text
Created successfully
```

If the request is invalid, Flask returns status `400` with a JSON error.

Examples:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing field: publisher"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid cost"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid date format"
}
```

### Important Design Detail

The SQL uses question marks:

```sql
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
```

This is called a **parameterized query**.

It is safer than directly joining strings into SQL because it helps prevent SQL injection.

---

## 19. API Endpoint: Update Book

Route:

```py
@app.route('/update/<int:id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_book(id):
```

Used by React:

```js
axios.put(`http://localhost:5001/update/${book.id}`, values)
```

The `<int:id>` part means Flask expects an integer in the URL.

Example:

```text
PUT /update/3
```

Backend logic:

```py
cursor.execute(
    "UPDATE book SET publisher=?, name=?, date=?, cost=? WHERE id=?",
    (updated_book['publisher'], updated_book['name'], updated_book['date'], updated_book['cost'], id)
)
```

This means:

1. Read JSON body.
2. Validate the request body.
3. Update the row whose ID matches.
4. Check whether a row was actually updated.
5. Return updated data inside a `data` object.

Successful response shape:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "publisher": "UpdatePub",
    "name": "UpdatedBook",
    "date": "2025-12-12",
    "cost": 60.0
  }
}
```

If the ID does not exist, Flask returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Book not found"
}
```

with status `404`.

---

## 20. API Endpoint: Delete Book

Route:

```py
@app.route('/delete/<int:id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_book(id):
```

Used by React:

```js
axios.delete(`http://localhost:5001/delete/${bookId}`)
```

Backend logic:

```py
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM book WHERE id=?", (id,))
```

This deletes one book by ID.

Then Flask returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Book deleted successfully"
}
```

If the ID does not exist, Flask returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Book not found"
}
```

with status `404`.

---

## 21. API Endpoint: Health Check

Route:

```py
@app.route("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}, 200
```

This endpoint is used to check if the backend is alive.

Example:

```text
GET http://localhost:5001/health
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

Current limitation:

This health check does not actually test the database. It only says the Flask server is running.

A stronger health check would try to connect to the database too.

---

## 22. HTTP Methods Used

This project uses REST-style HTTP methods.

| Method | Endpoint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Read all books |
| POST | `/create` | Create a new book |
| PUT | `/update/<id>` | Update an existing book |
| DELETE | `/delete/<id>` | Delete a book |
| GET | `/health` | Check server health |

REST means designing URLs around resources and using HTTP methods properly.

The resource here is:

```text
book
```

---

## 23. Frontend and Backend Communication

Frontend runs on:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Backend runs on:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

React sends HTTP requests to Flask.

Example create flow:

```text
User fills form
        |
        v
CreateBook.jsx stores data in state
        |
        v
User clicks Submit
        |
        v
Axios sends POST /create
        |
        v
Flask reads request JSON
        |
        v
Flask inserts into SQLite
        |
        v
Flask returns success response
        |
        v
React navigates to /
        |
        v
Books.jsx fetches and displays updated list
```

---

## 24. Styling Design

The project uses Bootstrap.

Bootstrap gives ready-made CSS classes.

Examples:

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `container` | Adds page width and spacing |
| `btn` | Button base style |
| `btn-success` | Green button |
| `btn-primary` | Blue button |
| `btn-danger` | Red button |
| `table` | Styled table |
| `form-control` | Styled input |
| `mb-3` | Margin bottom |
| `mt-3` | Margin top |
| `ms-2` | Margin start/left |

So instead of writing custom CSS, this project uses Bootstrap utility classes.

## 25. Testing Design

The project has multiple types of tests.

### 25.1 Playwright Tests

Folder:

```text
Client/tests/
```

Playwright tests the app like a real user in a browser.

It checks things like:

- Does the navigation header appear?
- Does the create form appear?
- Can a user fill fields?
- Can a user click buttons?
- Does routing work?

Config:

```text
Client/playwright.config.js
```

It uses:

```text
baseURL: http://localhost:5173/
```

So Playwright tests the React app.

### 25.2 Pytest Tests

Folder:

```text
Server/tests/pytest/
```

Pytest tests the Flask backend directly.

Important file:

```text
Server/tests/pytest/test_books_api.py
```

It tests:

- Health check
- Get books
- Create book
- Missing fields
- Invalid cost
- Invalid date
- Update book
- Delete book
- Nonexistent update ID
- Nonexistent delete ID
- Unknown route
- Method not allowed

After the backend updates, the Pytest suite passes:

```text
14 passed
```

Important design detail:

During Pytest, the app uses a separate temporary SQLite database instead of the real `Server/books.db`. This avoids test failures caused by the real database being open in Flask or DB Browser.

### 25.3 Newman/Postman Tests

Folder:

```text
Server/tests/postman_newman/
```

Postman is used to define API requests.

Newman runs those Postman tests from the command line.

This is useful for API testing and reports.

### 25.4 Unified Report

File:

```text
Server/tests/unified_report/test-report-generator.py
```

This script combines:

- Newman results
- Pytest results
- CSV test plan

Then it generates:

```text
Server/tests/unified_report/comprehensive-test-report.html
```

This is useful for showing testing coverage to seniors, QA, or managers.

## 26. Important Fixes and Remaining Issues

This is the part seniors usually care about. A good explanation should not only say what works, but also what was improved and what still needs attention.

### Fixed 1: `Cost` vs `cost`

Earlier, the project had inconsistent naming:

```text
React used: Cost
Database used: Cost
Flask expected: cost
```

That caused errors like:

```text
KeyError: 'cost'
```

Now the project uses lowercase everywhere:

```text
cost
```

So now:

- React sends `cost`
- Flask reads `cost`
- Flask returns `cost`
- SQLite schema uses `cost`

The backend also accepts an older request body containing `Cost` and normalizes it to `cost` before validation. This is useful when older database rows or older frontend code still contain uppercase `Cost`.

This fix is important for the update flow. Before this fix, clicking Update could send a request like:

```text
PUT /update/35
```

and Flask could reject it with:

```text
400 Bad Request
```

because the validator could not find a valid lowercase `cost` value.

Now the update form reads either value:

```jsx
cost: book?.cost ?? book?.Cost ?? ''
```

and sends:

```jsx
cost: Number(values.cost)
```

So updates work as long as the user enters a valid numeric cost.

### Fixed 2: Backend Validation

Earlier, the backend trusted all request bodies. If a field was missing, Flask crashed with `500`.

Now the backend validates create and update requests.

It checks:

- Request body must be JSON
- `publisher` must exist
- `name` must exist
- `date` must exist
- `cost` must exist
- `cost` must be numeric
- `date` must use `YYYY-MM-DD`

Bad input now returns status `400` with JSON errors.

Example:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing field: publisher"
}
```

### Fixed 3: Not Found Handling

Earlier, update and delete returned `200 OK` even if the book ID did not exist.

Now the backend checks `cursor.rowcount`.

If no row was updated or deleted, Flask returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Book not found"
}
```

with status `404`.

### Fixed 4: JSON Error Responses

Earlier, unknown routes returned Flask's default HTML error page.

Now unknown routes return JSON:

```json
{
  "error": "Resource not found"
}
```

Wrong HTTP methods return:

```json
{
  "error": "Method not allowed"
}
```

### Fixed 5: Pytest Database Isolation

Earlier, Pytest could fail because the real `Server/books.db` file was locked or had a leftover SQLite journal file.

Now Pytest uses a separate temporary SQLite database.

This keeps automated tests separate from real app data.

Result:

```text
14 passed
```

### Fixed 6: Safe Update Page Handling

Earlier, direct navigation to `/update` could crash because the page expected a selected book in router state:

```jsx
location.state.book
```

Now the page uses optional chaining:

```jsx
location.state?.book
```

If no book was selected, it shows a safe message and a Back to Books link.

The form also displays backend errors, such as invalid cost, instead of only logging them in the browser console.

### Remaining Issue 1: Ports Are Inconsistent In Some Older Docs

Current Flask app runs on:

```text
5001
```

React calls:

```text
5001
```

But some Newman/PostgreSQL docs mention:

```text
5000
```

This can cause test failures if the wrong port is used.

### Remaining Issue 2: SQLite vs PostgreSQL Docs

Current app uses SQLite.

But some files mention PostgreSQL and `psycopg2`.

That suggests the project may have originally been planned for PostgreSQL, then changed to SQLite, or the docs were generated for another version.

### Remaining Issue 3: Update Route Could Be More Robust

The update page no longer crashes when opened directly, but it still depends on a selected book being passed through router state.

A more robust design would be:

```text
/update/:id
```

Then fetch the book by ID.

### Remaining Issue 4: JSX Uses `class` Instead of `className`

In React JSX, we should use:

```jsx
className="form-control"
```

Not:

```jsx
class="form-control"
```

Some places in `CreateBook.jsx` use `class`.

### Remaining Issue 5: `wt-50` Looks Like a Typo

Bootstrap has:

```text
w-50
```

But the form uses:

```text
wt-50
```

That class probably does nothing.

## 27. How To Explain This Project To A Senior

You can say:

> This is a full-stack CRUD Book Management System. The frontend is built with React and Vite, and it uses React Router for page navigation. The backend is a Flask REST API that exposes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting books. SQLite is used as the database, and Axios is used by React to communicate with Flask. The UI uses Bootstrap for quick styling. The project also includes Playwright tests for frontend flows, Pytest tests for backend API behavior, Newman/Postman tests for REST API validation, and a unified report generator for combining test results.

Then continue:

> The frontend is component-based. `App.jsx` defines the routes, `Nav.jsx` shows the common header, `Books.jsx` fetches and displays all books, `CreateBook.jsx` posts new books to the API, and `UpdateBook.jsx` updates selected books using route state.

Then say:

> The Flask backend creates a SQLite connection per request, runs parameterized SQL queries, validates incoming JSON, returns proper HTTP status codes, and sends structured JSON responses. The database table has id, publisher, name, date, and cost fields.

Then mention improvements:

> We also improved the backend to match the Pytest contract. It now handles missing fields, invalid cost, invalid date, nonexistent update/delete IDs, JSON 404 errors, and JSON 405 errors. The app normalizes older uppercase `Cost` data to lowercase `cost`, which fixes update failures caused by frontend/backend field-name mismatch. Pytest uses a separate temporary SQLite database, so tests do not interfere with the real `books.db`.

Then mention remaining improvements:

> The main remaining cleanup areas are frontend polish: changing the update route to `/update/:id`, adding a get-one-book endpoint, changing JSX `class` to `className`, fixing `wt-50` to `w-50`, and making older docs/test environments consistently point to port `5001`.

That explanation is honest, technical, and clear.

## 29. Recommended Improvements

If improving this project, I would do these in order:

1. Change update route to `/update/:id`.
2. Add a backend endpoint to get one book by ID.
3. Use the book ID route to reload update data after browser refresh.
4. Move API base URL into an environment variable.
5. Fix JSX `class` to `className`.
6. Fix Bootstrap typo `wt-50` to `w-50`.
7. Update older docs and Newman environments so all ports use `5001`.
8. Decide clearly between SQLite and PostgreSQL in all documentation.
9. Add loading and error states in the React UI.
10. Add frontend form validation before sending data.
11. Add a global `500` JSON error handler for unexpected server errors.
12. Consider using a migration tool if the database schema grows.

## 30. Final Summary

This project is a simple but useful full-stack CRUD app.

The React frontend handles the user interface and sends API requests.

The Flask backend receives those requests, performs SQL operations, and returns JSON.

SQLite stores the actual book data.

The project also contains testing tools for frontend, backend, and API-level testing.

The current design is good for learning because it clearly shows how frontend, backend, and database layers connect. The backend has now been improved with consistent lowercase `cost` naming, compatibility for older uppercase `Cost` payloads, request validation, proper `400` and `404` responses, JSON error handlers, and a separate temporary database for Pytest. The update form now handles older `Cost` data, sends numeric cost values, shows API errors, and avoids crashing when `/update` is opened directly.

The main remaining improvements are mostly frontend and documentation polish: using `/update/:id` with a get-one-book endpoint, fixing minor JSX/Bootstrap class issues, and making every older doc/test environment agree on the same port and database story.

In one sentence:

> This project demonstrates a full-stack React + Flask + SQLite CRUD architecture with component-based UI, REST API communication, database persistence, backend validation, JSON error handling, and automated testing support.
